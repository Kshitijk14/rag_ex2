What is castling in chess?,"According to the provided context, castling in chess involves a single move where the king is transferred two squares towards one of the rooks on the same rank, and then that rook moves over the king to the adjacent square. This is often executed simultaneously with the king's move. However, there are variations and special rules for Chess960, including double-move castling, transposition castling, king-move-only castling, and rook-move-only castling.","Castling is a special move involving the king and either rook. The king moves two squares toward the rook, and the rook moves to the square the king crossed over. This can only be done if neither piece has moved, there are no pieces between them, the king is not in check, and the king doesn't pass through or end up in check.","rook at the same time, but castling on that side is illegal, the player
